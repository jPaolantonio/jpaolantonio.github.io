Hey, I'm James Paolantonio. Currently, an iOS and mobile developer in New York.
I am going to try to put down some thoughts on technology, code, and the
startup culture.

{% highlight swift %}
func printHi(name: String) {
    print("Hi " + name)
}
printHi("James")
#=> prints 'Hi, James'.
{% endhighlight %}
